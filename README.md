# dustsimulation
CMake project; Updated version of the dustsimulation code by Alex Seizinger. The code simulates dust agglomerates by computing the surface forces of dust monomers based on the model by [Wada et al. 2007](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJ...661..320W/abstract).  
The code runs on CPU and GPU via Cuda, the CPU version has a GUI created with QT.
